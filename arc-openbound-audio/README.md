Force Openbound part 1 (page 5263) to use MP3s, to get around an audo loading error (see [#432](https://github.com/Bambosh/unofficial-homestuck-collection/issues/432) on the unofficial-homestuck-collection); this resolves the specific problem I had, but there may be other similar errors that this does not fix

(This was also a quickly put together mod so it may not adhere to the best practices)
